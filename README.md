# ReFund-Frontend

The set up config of actually getting it running is annoying so if you run into problems (you likely will) tell me (also try google).

Install this

git is confusing to use at first read this if you don't know what's up.

Basically you're copying this project to your local computer, developing your bit 
then pushing your changes back here to the central repository.

Clone this repo into a local directory

in that directory run:

npm install

npm run start

then go to http://localhost:8080. (it may be a slightly different address but it will tell you.

Start developing. Harder part, there's a learning curve to this so just keep throwing hours and energy at it till it works.
There's react tutorials everywhere online (youtube, text, whichever). 

Also ask me, the smallest things will trip you up, a lot you won't be able fix on your own ( may be something I've set up wrong)

good luck
